# EconomicDataScraper

The purpose of this repository is to develop a web scraper that retrieves data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This project is developed in Python, with a focus on the scrapy and beautifulsoup frameworks.

Currently, the scraper parses a data table from <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm">https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t01.htm</a>, and saves the table as a .csv file (CPI_test_file.csv).
